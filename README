Sample solutions for various problems from ACM ICPC, UVa Online Judge
(http://uva.onlinejudge.org), and Programming Challenges
(www.programming-challenges.org).

Author: Abhishek Sarkar

I make no guarantees that solutions are correct. Problems for which I have test
inputs and outputs include that test data. UVa and PC problems which I know are
incorrect are explicitly marked "UNSOLVED".

I make no guarantees solutions will be comprehensible. More recent code I've
written is better documented. However, many solutions use ad-hoc algorithms
which may not be documented.
